12:58 03/09: Don't understand why when building the U slim tracklets in Station3,
we are really building the V slim tracklets (and vice versa); changed the
conditional statement in "buildTrackletsInStation", "buildTrackletsInStationU"
and "buildTrackletsInStationV", where the tracklet parameter is set, to make 
more succinct; editted the spacing and comments in lines

15:48 03/09: Why D1 is not used?; changed some iterators to range-based for,
which is more succint; deleted the two "continue;" statement in "buildBackPartialTracksSlimX",
which doesn't function here; other minor changes

18:17 03/09: The U-V inversion problem at station 3 seems more severe now
since the USlim in station2 and station3 at used togetor to build back tracklet;
Did the same update for "buildBackPartialTracksSlimU" and "buildBackPartialTracksSlimV";
Deleted some unused variables; Absobled "OLD_TRACKING" in "buildBackPartialTracksSlimX(U,V)"
to a more compact conditional expression

14:14 03/10: Changed the names of a set of data members Tracklet::st2X, Tracklet::st2Xsl,
etc. to make it more self-explanatory; other minor changes

17:25 03/10: Merged Tracklet::nXHits, Tracklet::nUHits and Tracklet::nVHits
to Tracklet::nHits[3]; Merged KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildTrackletsInStationSlim,
KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildTrackletsInStationSlimU and KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildTrackletsInStationSlimV
to KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildTrackletsInStationSlim; other minor
changes

18:25 03/10 Merged KalmanFastTracking::TrackletsInStSlimX[5], KalmanFastTracking::TrackletsInStSlimU[5]
and KalmanFastTracking::TrackletsInStSlimV[5] to KalmanFastTracking::TrackletsInStSlim[5][3];
other minor changes

9:53 03/12 Fixed some bugs so it can reproduce the same results on e906 data

17:59 03/12 Merged some data members containing X, U, V information to a
3 array; Merged KalmanFastTracking::compareTrackletsSlim, KalmanFastTracking::compareTrackletsSlimU
and KalmanFastTracking::compareTrackletsSlimV to KalmanFastTracking::compareTrackletsSlim;
Merged KalmanFastTracking::compareTrackletsSlim_3hits, KalmanFastTracking::compareTrackletsSlimU_3hits
and KalmanFastTracking::compareTrackletsSlimV_3hits to KalmanFastTracking::compareTrackletsSlim_3hits;
other minor changes

13:03 03/13 Merged KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildBackPartialTracksSlimX,
KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildBackPartialTracksSlimU and KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildBackPartialTracksSlimV
to KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildBackPartialTracksSlim; created two new
functions KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildXUCombos and KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildXUVCombos
to supplement the merged function; other minor changes

14:02 03/13 Fixed a bug so it can reproduce the same results on e906 data; other minor changes

16:09 03/13 Merged Tracklet::getSlopesX, Tracklet::getSlopesU and Tracklet::getSlopesV
to Tracklet::getSlopesX; other minor changes

18:50 03/14 Changes on data flows; other minor changes

17:40 03/19 Minor changes in KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildGlobalTracksDisplaced;
other minor changes

16:42 03/20 Added a new function KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::checkQuality
to do tracklet quality control; other minor changes

20:16 03/20 Adjusted the order of hits in FastTracklet::getSlope; Added KalmanFastTracking::assignSign
to resolve the sign of hits from the corresponding line index; other minor
changes 

13:42 03/21 Changed the loop structure in KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildTrackletsInStation1_NEW;
other minor changes

15:13 03/21 Deleted unuseful information in KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildBackPartialTracksSlim_v3;
other monir changes

16:04 03/21 Deleted KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::getNum1Combos; Deleted unused
information in KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildBackPartialTracksSlim_v3;
other minor changes

16:51 03/22 Modified KalmanFastTracking_Displaced::buildGlobalTracksDisplaced
to make it clearer; other minor changes

20:02 03/22 Fixed a bug so it can reproduce the same results for non-displaced
tracking
